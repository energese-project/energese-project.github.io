# CLAUDE.md

**[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the canonical standard for this repository. Read it first.**

Everything there applies to Claude Code: the stack, the container workflow, the component
conventions, the checks, and the contribution rules. This file deliberately does **not**
restate them — two copies of a standard drift apart, and then neither can be trusted. Add new
standards to `AGENTS.md`, not here.

## The ones that get broken most

1. **There is no local Node.** `node` and `npm` are not on this host. Every command goes
   through `make` and the Apple `container` image. Do not reach for `npx` directly.
2. **Push *and* open a PR.** CI runs on `pull_request`. A pushed branch with no PR has been
   tested by nothing.
3. **Do not merge your own PR.** Hand over a green one.
4. **A task is done when it is merged**, not when it is written. Check `main`.
5. **`make check` before every push**, in the branch that the PR will carry, so what the PR
   claims is what was actually tested.

## Verifying a visual change

`make build` proves it compiles, not that it looks right. For anything that changes layout,
run `make dev` and look at it, or add a Playwright assertion — the e2e suite already runs
against both the dev server and the built bundle, so an assertion there covers the shipped
artifact too.
